# HackBox

## Inspiration
We were inspired by Jackbox, an extremely fun party game. However, we're poor college students with no social lives so we needed a free alternative that didn't require us to share a screen. 24 hours and a few hundred mg of caffeine later, we're proud to present Hackbox!

## What it does
Hackbox allows 4 people to connect from anywhere around the world (with a decent wifi connection) and play together. Guess what answers your friends gave correctly to earn points and win the game!

## How we built it
We used pygame to make the client side and stored the necessary data on a Google Spreadsheet.

## Challenges we ran into
Desynchronization between players due to rapid data overwriting, lag and rate limits on the Google Drive API, learning pygame and how to draw, and designing and finishing a project in 24 hours. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Actually making a working game that we can all play on different computers.

## What we learned
We learned how to use the Google Drive API, basic client/server interactions, how to use pygame, and how to collaborate in order to overcome challenges.

## What's next for Hackbox
Ideally we would migrate off of Google Spreadsheets in order to reduce lag and avoid unnecessary challenges like the rate limit. We could also polish the UI and add a chat room so players can communicate while playing and have a more enjoyable experience.
